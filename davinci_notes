REFERENCE EVERYTHING TO one_psm_base_link:
  this frame has:
  origin at pivot point
  z "up"
  x to robot's right,
  y forward
  



start w/ gripper jaws closed--> "one_tool_tip_link" has z-axis pointing out, parallel to jaws;
--> origin of jaw-bend axis is at O_tip - z_tip*0.0102

...plan: given gripper-tip frame, can compute origin of gripper-jaw axis frame;
frame: one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link: 
    has origin on gripper-jaw axis 
    has z-axis along gripper-jaw axis
    rotates w/ jaw rotation

given tool-tip frame (w/rt one_psm_base_link) can find frame one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link (as above)
   this frame moves w/ q5 (gripper jaws rotation).

given frame one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link, find frame one_tool_wrist_sca_link
  one_tool_wrist_sca_link moves w/ wrist bend
  has z-axis colinear w/ wrist-bend axis
  has origin on wrist-bend axis
  has x-axis pointing towards gripper-jaw rotation axis

Given desired gripper frame, and given gripper-jaw rotation angle, find frame frame one_tool_wrist_sca_link

  ref frame: one_psm_base_link, 

 when jaw-bend (call it q6) is q6 = 0, then gripper jaws are straight out; y-axis of frame one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link
   is parallel to tool shaft, i.e. is coincident w/ x-axis of frame 
   Then frame one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link (distal frame) aligns w/ one_tool_wrist_sca_link, 
   axes of distal frame w/rt proximal frame = R_{one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link/one_tool_wrist_sca_link}

   R(q6=0) = [0  1  0
              0  0  1
              1  0  0]
   w/ q6!=0:
   R(q6) =   [sin(q6)  cos(q6)  0
                0        0      1
              cos(q6) -sin(q6)  0]

    == R_{6/5}

   GIVEN R_one_tool_wrist_sca_shaft_link/one_psm_base_link,
   FIND R_{one_tool_wrist_sca_link/one_psm_base_link}
    call these R_{6/5}, R_{6/0}, R_{5/0}, where R_{6/5} depends on q1 through q6

    R_{6/0} =   R_{6/5} * R_{5/0}

  ==>R_{5/0} =  R_{6/5}'*R_{6/0}  

    want to back up distance a6 along axis x_5 (first column of R_{5/0} to get to origin of frame 5 (w/rt 0)

    O_{5/0} = O_{6/0} - a6*xvec_{5/0}

AND
    R_{5/0} = R_{6/5}'*R_{6/0}  


therefore, frame 5 wrt 0 follows from given frame 6 wrt 0 and angle q6.


NEXT,
  given frame 5, compute frame 4 (one_tool_wrist_shaft_link) as a fnc of wrist bend, q5

one_tool_wrist_shaft_link:  does NOT move w/rt wrist bend; good frame to use upstream of wrist bend;
