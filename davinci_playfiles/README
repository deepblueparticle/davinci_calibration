//this directory contains example motion files 
// type *.jsp is a joint-space playfile, and *.csp is a Cartesian-space playfile

Joint-space format: (read by "playfile_reader/playfile_jointspace")

//specialized for dual-PSM davinci; assumes fixed order:
// entries 0-6 correspond to PSM1, joints 1-7; entries 7-13 are joints 1-7 of PSM2; entry 14 is desired arrival time (from start), in seconds.
//each line must contain all 15 values (in fixed order), separated by commas

Cartesian format:  (read by "playfile_reader/playfile_cartspace")
//files must be designed to account for relative positions of PSM1 and PSM2 base frames w/rt world

//the following are w/rt to frame ONE_PSM_BASE_LINK
//entries 0-2 = origin of PSM1 gripper tip (a point mid-way between the gripper jaw tips)
//entries 3-5 = x-axis direction for PSM1 gripper-tip frame (x-axis points parallel to gripper-jaw rotation axis; y-axis points from fingertip to fingertip)
//entries 6-8 = z-axis direction for PSM1 gripper-tip frame (z-axis points from wrist to tip)
//entry 9 = angle of jaw opening (in radians)

// repeat next entries for PSM2:
//the following are w/rt to frame TWO_PSM_BASE_LINK
//entries 10-12 = origin of PSM1 gripper tip (a point mid-way between the gripper jaw tips)
//entries 13-15 = x-axis direction for PSM1 gripper-tip frame (x-axis points parallel to gripper-jaw rotation axis; y-axis points from fingertip to fingertip)
//entries 16-18 = z-axis direction for PSM1 gripper-tip frame (z-axis points from wrist to tip)
//entry 19 = angle of jaw opening (in radians)

//entry 20 = desired arrival time (from start of trajectory, in seconds)

//each line must contain all 21 values (in fixed order), separated by commas
