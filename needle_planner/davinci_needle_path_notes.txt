PLAN FOR NEEDLE-DRIVE KINEMATICS:
wsn, 2/23/16

define the following frames:

GRIPPER FRAME: at present, the davinci gripper frame has its origin at the tip (of the chosen gripper, 1 or 2).
The gripper z-axis extends outward: from the wrist and through the gripper tip.
Define a "thumb" and a "forefinger", such that the gripper y-axis points from the thumb tip to the
forefinger tip.  (This matters because there are two different options for what appears to be the same
gripper pose, but if the two jaws were different colors, it would be obvious).

The gripper-frame x-axis (which is parallel to the rotational axis of thegripper jaws) follows from cross product of y into z (or tvec into bvec).

GRIPPER GRASP FRAME: The gripper grasp frame is a frame on the corresponding to
where the gripper touches the needle.  The contact points will be between the wrist point and
gripper tip--e.g., half-way.  The origin of this frame is at:
O_grsp/gripper = (0,0,-grip_depth), where grip_depth is the distance of the contact points from
the gripper tips.  Define the orientation of this frame to be parallel to the gripper frame.
The transform (grasp frame with respect to gripper frame) is thus:
T_grsp/gripper: R = identity; O_grsp/gripper = (0,0,-grip_depth)

NEEDLE FRAME: 
The needle, with radius "r", is a semicircle in a plane.
The needle-frame origin is the center of the circle that contains the needle.
The z-axis of the needle frame is perpendicular to plane of needle.
The positive direction of the z axis is defined consistent with a positive rotation of the
needle frame about its z axis corresponding to the correct direction for needle driving.
(i.e., the tip is leading and the tail follows).
The needle-frame x-axis points from the needle-frame origin to needle tip. 
  i.e., in the needle frame, the tip coordinates are (r,0,0) (constant values)


TISSUE FRAME:
Define the tissue-frame origin at the desired needle entrance pt.
Define an x-axis on the tissue surface, pointing from the entrance point towards the exit point.
The tissue-frame z-axis is the tissue surface normal (positive points away from the tissue).
The tissue-frame y-axis follows from the cross product, bvec into nvec (or zvec into xvec).

TISSUE-FRAME TRANSFORM:  T_tissue/lcam_opt_frame
The tissue frame can be expressed as a transform with respect to the left-camera optical frame.
This should be based on point-cloud selections.
The centroid of a selected patch on the tissue will define an entrance point, with coordinates 
expressed in the (left) camera (optical) frame.
Additionally, selection of point-cloud points on the tissue surface yields a surface normal vector,
expressed in the camera frame, i.e.: bvec_tissue/lcam_opt_frame.
The x-axis of the tissue frame (nvec_tissue) is defined as a vector from the entrance point to the exit point.

The exit point can be selected from the point cloud, or it can be computed, subject to constraints.

The y-axis of the tissue frame (t_tissue) follows from the cross product of tvec into bvec.

Full specification of nvec, tvec, bvec and origin of the tissue frame in camera coordinates is equivalent
to defining the transform T_tissue/lcam_opt_frame.

GRASP TRANSFORM:  T_needle/grasp
define a needle-grasp transform that relates the "grasp" frame on the gripper (needle/gripper contact
point) to the needle frame.  This transform should be static during needle driving.
A common example of this transform would be:

*needle z-axis parallel (or antiparallel) to gripper z axis 
*needle origin with respect to grasp frame = (0, +/-r, 0) = O_needle/grasp
  +/-r depends on whether gripper "thumb" or "forefinger" is "up" w/rt tissue frame

*must choose direction of needle x-axis (vector from grasp frame to needle tip), which
  depends on grasp along needle circumference (e.g. how close to the tip or, more likely
  how close to the suture end of the needle).  For bvec_needle/grasp = (0,0,1) (i.e., 
  needle z-axis parallel to gripper z-axis), the needle-frame x-axis (or nvec_needle) will
  lie in the grasp-frame x-y plane.
  
  For illustration, consider grabbing the needle with bvec_needle || bvec_gripper. This
  implies that the plane of the needle is perpendicular to the gripper z axis (our typical
  needle-grasp pose, although an option is for bvec_needle || -bvec_gripper).
  
  Thumb "up" vs thumb "down" is also an optional choice.  E.g., consider the common case that
  the tissue is horizontal, the gripper is above the tissue, the gripper z-axis (bvec_gripper)
  is parallel to the tissue (i.e., the gripper is also horizontal), and the "thumb" is above
  the "forefinger."  In this case the gripper y-axis, bvec_gripper, points "down" towards the tissue
  (antiparallel to the tissue normal vector).  The needle-frame origin is then at:
  O_needle/grasp = (0,r,0), and the needle tip is "below" the grasp origin (at positive value of
  y with respect to grasp frame).
  
  For illustration, if the needle is grasped mid-way (not recommended, but easily 
  visualized), tip and tail are then equidistant from the grasp-frame origin.
  In this case, the needle tip is at: tip/grasp = (r,r,0).
  
  For some other grasp on the needle (e.g., closer to the suture end), there
  will be a different static transform from the grasp frame to needle frame.  Commonly, though,
  vec_needle = +/-bvec_gripper and O_needle/grasp = (0,+/-r,0), but there is still one parameter
  to be defined to describe where on the needle it is being grasped.  This additional parameter
  will complete the static transform T_needle/grasp, which should be static while needle driving.
  
  
  
NEEDLE PATH:
The needle-frame z axis will be chosen to be parallel to the tissue and elevated above the
tissue by some distance  0 < needle_axis_offset < r. The needle-frame z-axis (bvec_needle)
will be ANTI-parallel to tissue-frame y-axis: bvec_needle = -tvec_tissue.
Needle driving will be a positive rotation about the needle z axis.

Start from needle x-axis (nvec_needle) anti-parallel to tissue-frame x-axis, i.e.:
nvec_needle = - nvec_tissue.

Decide how far to drive the needel (phi of needle rotation from start pose).
e.g., drive until the needle-frame x-axis is parallel to tissue-frame x-axis, i.e. 180-deg rot;
This may be optimal, as it would give gripper2 as much grasp opportunity (near the needle tip)
as gripper1 (which is grasping near the needle tail).

By default, drive as above, about the bvec_needle axis, 180-deg from the start pose, where the
initial pose of the needle frame has nvec_needle parallel to the tissue surface.

The origin of the needle frame will be above a point equidistant between the tissue entrance and
exit points.  Define d_mid = 1/2 (p_exit - p_entrance) (half the distance from entrance to exit point).
The needle origin for this case, with respect to the tissue frame, is: 
O_needle/tissue = (x_mid,0, needle_axis_offset).
The initial needle-frame orientation is:
orientation: nvec_needle/tissue = (-1,0,0)
             tvec_ = (0,0,1)
             bvec_needle/tissue = (0, -1, 0)
       == R0_needle/tissue
             
As the needle is driven, O_needle/tissue remains constant, but orientation rotates about the
needle z-axis, which is the tissue-frame -y axis.  If the needle frame is rotated by angle phi-->
R(phi)_needle/tissue = Roty(phi)*R0_needle/tissue.
The above equations define the transform T_needle/tissue.

COMPUTING DESIRED GRIPPER FRAME:
Given the desired needle pose with respect to the tissue, T_needle/tissue (which is a function of 
insertion angle, phi), use inverse of T_needle/gripper to get T_gripper/tissue;
then use T_tissue/lcam_opt_frame to get T_gripper/lcam_opt_frame.
Then use inv(T_psm1/lcam_opt_frame) or T_psm2/lcam_opt_frame to get T_gripper1/psm1 or T_gripper2/psm2
(for choice of PSM 1 or 2).  Use existing IK routines to solve for corresponding joint displacements.
